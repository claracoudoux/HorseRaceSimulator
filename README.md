## Part 2: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Version

- **Method used:** `startRace()` (handled inside GUI events)
- **Location:** Inside the `Race` class (in Part2).
- **How it is invoked:**  
  When you click the **"Start Race"** button in the GUI, the `startRace()` method is called automatically behind the scenes.  
  There is **no separate method called `startRaceGUI()`** â€” the GUI button internally triggers `startRace()` for you.
