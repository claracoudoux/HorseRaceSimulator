##  Part 1: Console Text Version

- **Method used:** `startRace()`
- **Location:** Inside the `Race` class (in Part1).
- **How it is invoked:**  
  When you run `java Race`, the `main()` method inside `Race.java` automatically creates a race and calls `startRace()`.  
  You **do not need to manually call** `startRace()` yourself â€” it runs as part of the program flow.
